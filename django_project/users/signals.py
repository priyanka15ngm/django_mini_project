# broke on initially letting people use it. Someone tried to submit a comment over 255. It through a 500 error, comment still created, but no notification. When i tried to delete a user whose pictures was commented on it threw a 500 error coudl not find notfcaiton for query. so i took out the notiofcation deletion code above. Shouldnt be too detrimental but should fix.
